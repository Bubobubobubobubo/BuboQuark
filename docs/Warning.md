# Before reading this guide


This guide is a not a general purpose tutorial. It will not teach you how to use
SuperCollider. If you are brave enough, you can learn by doing/following the
steps. However, you will sometimes feel the need to read other sources to fill
the gaps. I am not a SuperCollider guru and I do just that when the need arises.

## Learning resources

There are already many great resources to learn SuperCollider. I recommend the
following among many other ressources:


- [SuperCollider for the Creative Musician](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/supercollider-for-the-creative-musician-9780197616994?cc=fr&lang=en&) by Eli FieldSteel: the best educator I know to learn SuperCollider. The book can be expensive for some people. If you can't afford it, read the following point.
  - [Eli Fieldsteel YouTube
  Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/elifieldsteel): Eli Fieldsteel has made
  a great series of video tutorials that are free to watch. This is the best way
  to learn SuperCollider that I am aware of.

- [A gentle introduction to SuperCollider](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ruviaro/texts/A_Gentle_Introduction_To_SuperCollider.pdf) by Bruno Ruviaro: a great introduction to SuperCollider with an emphasis of making music / composing first. Especially great for patterns and sequencing.

- [A practical Guide](https://doc.sccode.org/Browse.html#Streams-Patterns-Events%3EA-Practical-Guide) by H. James Harkins: already included in the SuperCollider help files. Easy to read, with interactive code examples.

## Lurking around

It's probably a good idea to lurk around the SuperCollider community to see what
people are doing with the software and how they make music with it. I really
like to spend hours browsing the web. Here are some good resources:

- [SCCode](https://sccode.org/): some website where people post their
SuperCollider code. You can find some classics there and some recent
experiments too!
- [SuperCollider Forum](https://scsynth.org): obviously, the official forum.
This is where most of the gurus are answering questions to new users and having
debated about some aspects of the language or audio server.
- [YouTube](https//youtube.com): just search _supercollider live coding_ or
something like that. Tons of people are posting their live coding sessions.
There is [Nathan Ho](https://www.youtube.com/@synth_def), [Jaxa](https://www.youtube.com/@JaxaSound) and all the live coding folks that play in the [Eulerroom](https://www.youtube.com/@Eulerroom).

# Code Editors

**SCIde** is the default code editor for SuperCollider. It works super well and
it has been fine-tuned for years to be a robust companion for the language. I
recommend you to use it if you don't have much experience with SuperCollider. It
will do its best to help you and it will be easier to browse help files from
there.

I tend to use [Neovim]() because I do most things in Neovim these days. Some
other people [wrote about using it](https://madskjeldgaard.dk/posts/neovim-as-sc-ide/) with SuperCollider so I am not going to repeat everything. Just install [scnvim](https://github.com/davidgranstrom/scnvim) and go with the flow. This plugin is very well made and can replace the IDE if you configure it well. It is also very lightweight which is always a plus if you intend to run SuperCollider on a potato computer.

There is some efforts in the community aiming to make [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) usable with SuperCollider but it is still [an ongoing effort](https://scsynth.org/t/vscode-supercollider-current-state-macos/8312). It is probably already usable if you take the time to install it.

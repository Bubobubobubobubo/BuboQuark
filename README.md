# BuboQuark: A Live Coding Companion

This repository is a collection of methods, hacks and tips I found to make live coding easier on **SuperCollider**. 

## What is BuboQuark?

BuboQuark is an experimental and not-yet-ready Quark (a plugin) for SuperCollider. It adds a few methods, objects and operators that make live coding easier on stage. It is inspired by a long tradition of high-level frameworks such as FoxDot, TidalCycles, [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr) and so on. It is also inspired by the trove of techniques that people shared for nearly twenty years about using SuperCollider as a battleproof performance tool.

BuboQuark is initialized using the `Boot()` command and adds the following features:
- automatic handling of an audio sample library
- operators for creating patterns on-the-fly: `=>`, `->`, `==`, `>>`, `>>+`
- convenience methods for adding FXs to an existing pattern
- patterning capabilities (`pat:`) key + other shortcuts

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a technique/method that you think is worth sharing, please open a pull request. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue. There might be some things that I missed, or that could be improved. Please, let me know!

## About the website

There is a [small companion website](https://bubobubobubobubo.github.io/BuboQuark/#/) that initially came with the repo but I never updated it properly :). It will host a tutorial when things will settle in the distant future.
